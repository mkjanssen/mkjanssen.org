I live in Sioux Center, IA, with my wife, daughter, son, and cat. My wife says that I can make anything nerdy, which I take as a badge of honor. My nerdy hobbies include:

### Distance running

In November 2019 I decided to go for a run. I couldn't walk the next day, but I was hooked. As of the end of 2022, I've run six half marathons and three marathons, with one of each planned for 2023.

### Tabletop gaming

I've played board games with my wife and friends for years, but recently jumped into the deep end of modern hobbyist gaming. My current favorites are [Terraforming Mars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars), anything by [Splotter](https://splottershop.com), and the genre of [18xx train games](https://18xx.games).

As of summer 2023, I'm trying to learn chess.
