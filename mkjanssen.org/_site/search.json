    "text": "I live in Sioux Center, IA, with my wife, daughter, son, and cat. My wife says that I can make anything nerdy, which I take as a badge of honor. My nerdy hobbies include:\n\nDistance running\nIn November 2019 I decided to go for a run. I couldn’t walk the next day, but I was hooked. As of the end of 2022, I’ve run six half marathons and three marathons, with one of each planned for 2023.\n\n\nTabletop gaming\nI’ve played board games with my wife and friends for years, but recently jumped into the deep end of modern hobbyist gaming. My current favorites are Terraforming Mars, anything by Splotter, and the genre of 18xx train games.\nAs of summer 2023, I’m trying to learn chess."

    "text": "Teaching\nI have taught a wide variety of mathematics courses throughout my 15 years in higher education. My courses aim to create space in which students are offered the experience of doing mathematics. I want them to deeply understand that mathematics is a cultural activity practiced by particular people in a particular time and place. Thus, I want my students to experience mathematics as working mathematicians do: the questioning, the struggle, and ultimately, the joy of discovery.\nTo that end, I incorporate active/inquiry-based learning in (nearly) all of my classes. The particular type of active learning depends a great deal on the students and the class, but students who take part in my courses should know that they will be expected to dig deeply, struggle, and learn a lot.\nI am also interested in the use of alternative assessment practices in my courses to encourage a growth mindset and student mastery of core concepts.\nFor more, see my teaching page or my teaching statement."

Mathematically, they could broadly be described as exploring the connections between commutative algebra (usually symbolic powers of homogeneous ideals) and other areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry and graph theory. A unifying question in my work explores the relationship between an ideal’s symbolic and ordinary powers.\nI’ve also had the pleasure of directing several undergraduate research projects, generously funded by Dordt University’s Kielstra Center for Research and Grants.\nFor more, including a list of talks and publications, see my research page. For a detailed description of past, ongoing, and future work (including undergraduate research), see my research statement.\nFollow me on Mathstodon"

    "text": "My scholarly interests lie in two main areas: the intersections of commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and graph theory; and, scholarly teaching, including the use of mastery assessments and inquiry-based learning.\n\n\nMy dissertation research was in the exploration of the so-called containment problem. In its most general form, one may ask, given a homogeneous ideal \\(I\\), for which \\(m\\) and \\(r\\) is the symbolic power \\(I^{(m)}\\) contained in the ordinary power \\(I^r\\)? In addition to exploring this question in my dissertation in the context of algebraic geometry, I explored a related question in the context of edge ideals \\(I(G)\\). In that case, certain invariants of \\(I\\) related to invariants of the underlying (simple) graph \\(G\\).\n\n\n\nI am also very interested in the use of research-based methods for teaching and assessment. As I describe elsewhere, I am a proponent of active learning (thought of broadly) in all my courses, and I am also interested in the use of low-stakes, mastery-based assessments tied to clear standards for the purposes of encouraging mastery of fundamental skills and the development of a growth mindset in mathematics.\nI compiled some WeBWorK-based preview activities for an elementary linear algebra course."
